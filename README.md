# Voda Home Experience

This repository contains a Flutter implementation of the Voda home screen based on the provided design reference. The layout showcases the hero streak banner, quick stats row, active lake carousel, community spotlights, and a latest lakes grid using mock data so the page feels populated out of the box.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (version 3.16 or newer is recommended).
2. From the repository root, fetch the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app on a connected device or emulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The primary implementation lives in [`lib/main.dart`](lib/main.dart).
